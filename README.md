# 🧮 React Calculator App

This is a simple calculator project built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed as a learning tool to explore and practice core concepts of React development.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and keeps a **history of calculations**. The app is fully responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS with custom themes.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was extremely helpful in understanding and applying foundational concepts of React, including:

- **JSX syntax** — Writing UI with embedded logic.
- **Components** — Creating reusable, functional components like `Button`, `Card`, and `Text`.
- **Props & State** — Passing data to components and managing dynamic behavior using `useState`.
- **Context API** — Sharing state between components without prop drilling.
- **Hooks** — Using `useEffect`, `useState`, and `useContext` for side effects and state management.
- **Event handling** — Creating functions to handle user interaction (e.g., button clicks).
- **Conditional rendering** — Dynamically showing or hiding UI elements.
- **Styling with Tailwind** — Applying utility-first classes and custom themes using CSS variables.

## 📁 Features

- Basic calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- Clean and modern UI with a custom color palette.
- Responsive layout (mobile and desktop).
- Persistent **operation history** stored in `localStorage`.
- Keyboard-friendly structure (could be extended in the future).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React (with Babel)** – Functional components and hooks.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling.
- **LocalStorage** – To persist history between sessions.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – For logic and rendering.

## 💡 Next Steps

- Add keyboard support.
- Improve validation and error handling.
- Add advanced operations (square root, percentage, parentheses).
- Convert to a full React app using a bundler like Vite.

## 📚 Inspiration

This project was inspired by the need to **practice real-world UI building** with React while reinforcing concepts in a visually satisfying and interactive way.
